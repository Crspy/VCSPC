Source code of VCSPC DLL file, the core of all code changes in Vice City Stories PC Edition.
This very code allowed VCSPC to become more than just a map mod for GTA: San Andreas.
Here you'll find countless changes to the game's engine we've worked on between 2012 and 2018.

Feel free to reuse parts of this code for your heart's content, but credit us if possible.
Thanks and enjoy!
